This practical involves using the Qemu emulator to simualate the Microcontroller.
This practical mainly focuses on the elaboration of the importance of C and C++ in the Embeded Systems development realm.
The Python program was used as the Golden Measure.

This will show us how using different programming languages can impact the performance of
the program. From there, weâ€™ll try and improve the performance of the C code as much as
possible, by using different bit widths, compiler flags and threading.
The quest for optimisation can lead one down a long, unending spiral. What is important to
take away from this practical is the awareness of optimisation concepts and the ability to use
good practice when benchmarking.
